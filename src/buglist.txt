     PowerPoint Picture Insert Command Line Interface (P3ICLI) Bug List
     ==================================================================

- If File Explorer (nee Windows Explorer) preview mode displays a powerpoint
  presentation when p3icli scripting begins, an attempt will be made to connect
  to the (crippled) presentation resident in the Explorer's preview pane.  The
  crippled presentation is essentially read-only, so a cascade of errors ensues
  and p3icli aborts.  The -Ex command line switch can be used to automatically
  close File Explorer under certain conditions.  Refer to the documentation
  topic entitled "PowerPoint Instability On Windows 10" for further discussion.

- In an Office 2010 or later environment, if a "start ppt minimized" command
  is used to start PPT, the application's window pops open (to a "normal"
  state) as soon as a slide presentation is created.  This is a PPT
  regression (with respect to all previous versions of the program).

- When a template containing a slide master configuration created with a
  newer version of PPT is subsequently referenced by P3ICLI while
  interfacing with older versions of PPT, slide index out-of-range errors
  may be reported.  This problem has been observed when testing Office
  2003 and 2007 in a single use case that most users will not encounter.
  There is no solution for this problem via P3ICLI changes.  In such OOR
  situations, try these workarounds:

    b) Upgrade to a newer PPT version, or
    c) Delete unused master slides until OOR errors no longer occur, or
    a) If the template is stored in .ppt format, save it in a newer format.
       For example:  .ppt => .pptx.

- P3ICLI does not search for multiple shapes tagged with the same
  user-specified label (e.g., all caption shapes labeled "cap2").
  Instead P3ICLI stops searching after the first label match.
  Consequently, do _not_ create shapes with duplicate labels
  (this is easy to do when copying and pasting PowerPoint shapes).
  Duplicate shape labels lead to extremely vexing script errors.  For
  example, given two captions labeled "cap2", this command only
  labels _one_ caption:

      cap2 "My caption 2 text"

     P3ICLI is a mature product, now in maintenance stage.  Send
