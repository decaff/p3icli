p3icli: line 1: warning: Windows Explorer is running as a visible process.

                 Explorer may cause PPT instability if a P3ICLI script uses
                 the command "copy src fmt on" . Refer to the help topic 
                        "PowerPoint Instability On Windows 10"
                 in the reference manual for further details.  Pay attention
                 to the discussion of P3ICLI commandline switches that either
                 suppress this warning or automatically kill Windows Explorer.
