# P3ICLI (PowerPoint Picture Insert Command Line Interface)

## Overview

P3ICLI is a console-based, script-driven application that inserts
user-selected picture and/or graphic files into
Microsoft PowerPoint ® slides.

## Why Use P3ICLI?

**Q**: Why not rely solely on PowerPoint's "Insert Picture" user interface?

**A**: P3ICLI is designed for use in a script-driven environment from which a
simple text file inserts a large number of picture and/or graphics files into a
PowerPoint presentation.

In point of fact, P3ICLI was created to meet the needs of a statistician who:

    * Writes automated, custom analyses using JMP or SAS, which in turn
    * Create a large number of graphs (150+/analysis), that
    * Must be subsequently displayed on Powerpoint slides.

Note that inserting more than a handful of files via PowerPoint's human
interface is an _**extremely**_ tedious process.
