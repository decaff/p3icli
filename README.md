# P3ICLI (PowerPoint Picture Insert Command Line Interface)

## Overview

P3ICLI is a console-based, script-driven application that inserts
user-selected picture and/or graphic files into
Microsoft PowerPoint ® slides.

## Why Use P3ICLI?

**Q**: Why not rely solely on PowerPoint's "Insert Picture" user interface?

**A**: P3ICLI is designed for use in a script-driven environment from which a
simple text file inserts a **significant** number of picture and/or graphics
files into a PowerPoint presentation.

In point of fact, P3ICLI was created to meet the needs of a statistician who:

    * Writes automated, custom analyses using JMP or SAS, which in turn
    * Create a large number of graphs (150+/analysis), that
    * Must be subsequently displayed on PowerPoint slides.

But since P3ICLI is a command line tool, it can be invoked from any number of
other tools capable of exec'ing a process, including (for example)
perl, python, and bash.
